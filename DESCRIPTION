Description: Efficient framework to estimate high-dimensional generalized matrix 
    factorization models using penalized maximum likelihood under a dispersion 
    exponential family specification. Either deterministic and stochastic methods 
    are implemented for the numerical maximization. In particular, the package 
    implements an original stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a block-wise 
    mini-batch strategy to speed up the computations and an efficient adaptive 
    learning rate schedule to stabilize the convergence. Other methods considered 
    for the optimization are the alternated iterative re-weighted least squares and 
    the quasi-Newton method with diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix.
