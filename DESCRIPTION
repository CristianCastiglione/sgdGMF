Description: The sgdGMF package provides an efficient infrastructure 
    to estimate high-dimensional generalized matrix factorization (GMF) models using
    penalized maximum likelihood under a dispersion exponential family specification.
    Either deterministic and stochastic methods are implemented for the numerical 
    maximization. In particular, the package implements an 
    original stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a blocking minibatch strategy
    to speed up the computations and an efficient adaptive learning rate schedule to
    stabilize the convergence. Other methods considered for the optimization are the
    alternated iterative re-weighted least squares (AIRWLS) and the quasi-Newton method
    with diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix.
