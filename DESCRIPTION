Title: Generalized Matrix Factorization via Stochastic Gradient Descent
Version: 0.0.1
Authors: Cristian Castiglione, Davide Risso
Maintainer: Cristian Castiglione <cristian.castiglione@unipd.it>
Description: Factorization of matrices under the assumptions of the GLLVM model. 
    This is an extension of classical tools such as PCA and SVD when data is not Gaussian. 
    The package contains an implementation of two algorithms, that are Alternating 
    Reweighted Iterative Least Squares (ARILS) and quasi-Newton approach, where 
    derivatives and Hessians are approximated directly (Kidzinski et al. 2020).
