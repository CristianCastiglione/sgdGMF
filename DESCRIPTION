Description: Efficient framework to estimate high-dimensional generalized matrix factorization models using penalized maximum likelihood under a dispersion exponential family specification. Either deterministic and stochastic methods are implemented for the numerical maximization. In particular, the package implements the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a block-wise mini-batch strategy to speed up the computations and an efficient adaptive learning rate schedule to stabilize the convergence. All the theoretical details can be found in Castiglione et al. (2024, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.20509>). Other methods considered for the optimization are the alternated iterative re-weighted least squares and the quasi-Newton method with diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix discussed in Kidzinski et al. (2022, <http://jmlr.org/papers/v23/20-1104.html>).
