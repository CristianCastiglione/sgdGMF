Description: The sgdGMF package provides an efficient infrastructure 
    to estimate high-dimensional generalized matrix factorization (GMF) models using
    penalized maximum likelihood under a dispersion exponential family specification.
    Either deterministic and stochastic methods are implemented for the numerical 
    maximization. In particular, the package implements an original stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a block-wise minibatch strategy to speed up
    the computations and an efficient adaptive learning rate schedule to stabilize
    the convergence. Other methods considered for the optimization are the alternated
    iterative re-weighted least squares (AIRWLS) and the quasi-Newton method with
    diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix.
