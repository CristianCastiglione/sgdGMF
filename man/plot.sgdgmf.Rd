\item{type}{the type of plot which should be returned}

\item{subsample}{if \code{TRUE}, computes the residuals over o small fraction of the data}

\item{sample.size}{the dimension of the sub-sample which should be used}

\item{partial}{if \code{TRUE}, computes the partial residuals}

\description{
Plots (one of) six diagnostics to graphically analyze the marginal and conditional
distribution of the residuals of a GMF model. Currently, the following plots are
available: residuals against observation indices, residuals agains fitted values,
absolute square-root residuals against fitted values, histogram of the residuals,
residual QQ-plot, residual ECDF-plot.
