\description{
Provide four initialization methods to set the initial values of the parameters of
a generalized matrix factorization (GMF) model identified by a \code{\link{glm}} family
and a linear predictor of the form \eqn{g(\mu) = \eta = X B^\top + \Gamma Z^\top + U V^\top},
with bijective link function \eqn{g(\cdot)}.
See \code{\link{sgdgmf}} for more details on the model specification.

\details{
\code{method="svd"}: the initialization is performed fitting a sequence of linear
regressions followed by a residual SVD decomposition.
To account for the non-Gaussian distribution of the data, regression and
decomposition are applied on the transformed response matrix \eqn{Y_h = g(h(Y))},
where \eqn{h(\cdot)} is a function which prevent \eqn{Y_h} to take infinite values.
For instance, in the Binomial case \eqn{h(y) = 2 (1-\epsilon) y + \epsilon},
while in the Poisson case \eqn{h(y) = y + \epsilon}, where \eqn{\epsilon} is a small
positive constant, typically \code{0.1} or \code{0.01}.

\code{method="glm"}: the initialization is performed by fitting a sequence of
generalized linear models followed by a residual SVD decomposition.
In particular, we use independent GLM fit \eqn{y_j \sim X \beta_j} to set \eqn{\beta_j}.
Similarly, we fit the model \eqn{y_i \sim Z \gamma_i + o_i} with offset \eqn{o_i = B x_i}
to set \eqn{\gamma_j}. Then, \eqn{U} and \eqn{V} are obtained via SVD on the final
working residuals.

\code{method="random"}: the initialization is performed using independent Gaussian
random values for all the parameters in the model

\code{method="values"}: the initialization is performed using the user-specified
values provided as an input. The parameters not provided by the user are set
using the same strategy described in \code{method="svd"}.
