\value{
Returns a \code{data.frame}  containing the current number of latent factors
in the model (\code{ncomp}), the fold identifier (\code{fold}), the degrees of
freedom, i.e. the number of parameters, of the model (\code{df}), the AIC, BIC
and deviance (respectively, \code{aic}, \code{bic}, \code{dev})
calculated on the train and test sets.
}
\description{
Internal function running a single step of cross-validation for generalized
matrix factorization (GMF) models and calculating some goodness-of-fit measures
on the train and test sets.
